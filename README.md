**Team Feynman Blog Post 3: April 20th 2020**

This week we got feedback from a group of students on our game.

Andrew worked on implementing suggested changes based on student feedback, as well as fixed bugs and other issues in each scene that was surrounding an issue with a material getting edited or a prefab. He added text to the start and end scene. Andrew also added sounds for during collecting a collectible, music to each level, and he added a win sound for when the final end room has been reached.

Dinakar worked on the suggested changes based on the student feedback,as well as refining his game same.Completed the scripts for the level of the game.Tried to implement shaders and materials for the game.Worked on the prefab issue and completed the final room for the level.

Michael worked on suggested changes as well as fixing bugs that were discovered through testing. He added in the third puzzle to his level and worked out the logic needed to get the puzzles transitions to work correctly.

This week we worked on our rooms in each level, for deploying our first build. 

Andrew fixed bugs in his first room then designed his second room as well. He created the logic to unlock the next door given completion on his second room. For his rooms he also added basic UI to display steps for the user, making sure that the user was capable of performing these tasks successfully to proceed in the game. He also cleaned up his scene to better allow the player to move around. Andrew also spent time on trying to fix the WebGL build issues that our team had, ultimately Dinakar solved it. Lastly, Andrew updated the website and he also added text instructions to the lobby scene.

Dinakar worked on the rooms in his level,logic for unlocking the door for first and second rooms and various game play animations required in the improvement of the game.Spent time on fixing the webgl issues and working on the project settings to make the primary deliverable available.Should still complete the remaining room and complete the UI for the game.

Michael worked on the rooms of his level. He created the basic design and wrote the scripts for the functionality of the first two rooms. He also created a basic UI to walk the player through the level with instructions for each room that is entered.

This past week as a team we have met with both Alex and Dr. Joerg in two separate meetings. Here we discussed cohesion of our game, and decided that we will have 3 levels total that each contain 3-4 rooms that need to be escaped to move onto the next level. Each of these levels will have similar mechanics that are used to solve the puzzle to open the next room. We decided that we want to each have one room that uses a mechanic to pick up objects, these puzzles will have the option to have objects that can be used to confuse the users attempts to solve the puzzle. The next room that each level will incorporate is a collectible room, where the user has to gather all the collectibles in the room to unlock the next area. These two mechanics will be similar across levels so that there will be a level of cohesion and we can use the same scripts and assets for these two ideas. The final room will be a unique puzzle that provides challenges to the player.

We also discussed the story of our game was going to be about escaping the game as a whole in a certain amount of time to add pressure and excitement to the player. We can also add in penalties and other mechanics if the player doesnâ€™t finish in a certain amount of time. Furthermore, we can add time limits to each specific level to keep the player on track for the game.

Specifically last week Dinakar was working on his level in his game and working on various scripts,necessary for the animation triggers. Andrew created the scene management script as well as the lobby start scene and end scene. Andrew also created a basic pick up script that can pickup different types of objects, this script contains a carry location and drop location which can be used for all the other levels. Lastly, Andrew created the logic for the first puzzle in his level. Michael worked on his level design and started researching how to implement UIs in unity in order to assist in the storyline of the game.
