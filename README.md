Team Feynman Blog 1: April 6th 2020

This past week as a team we have met with both Alex and Dr. Joerg in two separate meetings. Here we discussed cohesion of our game, and decided that we will have 3 levels total that each contain 3-4 rooms that need to be escaped to move onto the next level. Each of these levels will have similar mechanics that are used to solve the puzzle to open the next room. We decided that we want to each have one room that uses a mechanic to pick up objects, these puzzles will have the option to have objects that can be used to confuse the users attempts to solve the puzzle. The next room that each level will incorporate is a collectible room, where the user has to gather all the collectibles in the room to unlock the next area. These two mechanics will be similar across levels so that there will be a level of cohesion and we can use the same scripts and assets for these two ideas. The final room will be a unique puzzle that provides challenges to the player.

We also discussed the story of our game was going to be about escaping the game as a whole in a certain amount of time to add pressure and excitement to the player. We can also add in penalties and other mechanics if the player doesnâ€™t finish in a certain amount of time. Furthermore, we can add time limits to each specific level to keep the player on track for the game.

Specifically last week Dinakar was working on his level in his game and working on various scripts,necessary for the animation triggers. Andrew created the scene management script as well as the lobby start scene and end scene. Andrew also created a basic pick up script that can pickup different types of objects, this script contains a carry location and drop location which can be used for all the other levels. Lastly, Andrew created the logic for the first puzzle in his level. Michael worked on his level design and started researching how to implement UIs in unity in order to assist in the storyline of the game.
